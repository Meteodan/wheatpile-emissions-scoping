## Prep checklists

### Scouting visit prep

* [x] prep both DustTrak II units w/ PM<sub>2.5</sub> & PM<sub>10</sub> inlets
* [x] verify Kestrel weather meter working OK, print user manual

### Data systems

#### Tracer release station

CO2 (tracer) point-source release equipment

* [x] ~~pure CO2 tanks~~ *ordered (4) 50# tanks*
* [x] ~~regulator~~ *order one new, other from IAQ*
    * [x] ~~test for regulator freeze-up~~ *does frost over but direct sunlight
          is sufficient to prevent freezing; tested up to full range 20+50 SLPM*
    * [ ] install heat tape on new regulator
* [x] ~~digital flowmeter~~ *one 50SLPM from 415, other 20LPM from IAQ*
* [x] ~~DustTrak II w/ PM2.5 inlet~~ *unit #1 (s/n 8530150710)*
    * [x] ~~verify logger program has correct det. scaling from IAQ study~~
* [x] ~~Licor LI-840A CO2/H2O analyzer + pump *unit #2 (s/n HGA-2573)~~
    * [x] ~~validate analog voltage scaling range~~
    * [x] ~~add backup analog measurement CO2 only~~
* [x] ~~GPS unit~~ *s/n 1A4171474*
    * [x] ~~verify programmed for use with CR1000~~
* [ ] Campbellsci datalogger *s/n 50905*
